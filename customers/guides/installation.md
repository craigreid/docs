# How to Install the App

After you have set up your first event, you should install the app on all the devices that need to be used. For this simple process you will need:

* Your iPad, iPad Mini or iPhone with all recent software updates
* A good Wi-fi internet connection

You will only need to perform this process once per device.

### Having difficulties installing Akkroo?</h3>

If you encounter any difficulties installing the app, please check:

* Your internet connection is working.
* You are connected to Wi-fi rather than 3G, 4G or a cellular network.
* You have the latest versions of iOS with all recent updates installed.
* You are using mobile Safari. Other browsers for iPad such as Google Chrome will not work.
* If you experience something similar to the error message below, it means there is not enough processing memory allocated for Akkroo to operate efficiently, so please ensure that:

* You have cleared the cache on your device (Settings > Safari > Clear Cookies and Data).
* Private Browsing is turned off (Settings > Safari > Private Browsing).
