<h4>Restricted:</h4>
<p>This user may login to the Dashboard and view event data.</p>

<h4>Normal:</h4>
<p>This user has the same access as a Restricted user, but additionally is allowed to download and export data, and manage new events.</p>

<h4>Account Owner:</h4>

<p>Once the level of access for the new user has been chosen, their account needs to be created using their <strong>Full Name</strong> and <strong>E-mail</strong>.</p>

<p>Following clicking ‘Create New User’, a welcome email will be sent to the registered email address, with instructions on how to set up their new dashboard account.</p>
