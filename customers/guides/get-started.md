### Creating Your First Event

The first time you log into the dashboard, you will be prompted to create your first event (term used for an occasion or period of time that you wish to collect data). For example, you may have a specific one-day event that you want to collect data at, or you may have a two-week period where you are collecting data every day.

To create your first event, click on the ‘Setup your Event First Event’ button and follow the on-screen instructions (or if an event has already been created and you want to create a new one, click on the ‘New Event’ button and follow the same process).

There are two types of event you can create:

#### Data Capture

To be used when you want to instantly capture any type of data and information including the registration of new candidates/delegates/attendees.

#### Event Check In

To be used when you are running an event that requires delegates to ‘check-in’ on arrival. There are two options within this event type that both allow you ask additional questions after the delegate has checked-in or signed-up.

* **Check-in Only:** Allowing only pre-registered delegates can check-in at your event.
* **Allow new sign-ups:** Delegates can check-in or register at your event.


### Uploading a Delegate List

Once you have chosen a type of event check-in, you will have the option to style your form and view an example user check-in list. The final stage is to upload your check-in list, so click ‘Save & Finish’ to create your event and then you will be prompted to upload your delegate list.

Click on the ‘Upload a file’ button to import your list of attendees in either CSV or Excel format. Once uploaded, assign each column with the relevant header.

Please Note: The check-in events will only display the delegate’s first name and last name on the app itself, but has been designed to hold additional information against each delegate so when download, all data columns remain. For columns that are required to remain, select ‘Keep data’ from the drop-down selection for the header.

### Event Duplication

Do you have an upcoming event that will require some or maybe all of the fields, colours and styles used in a previous event? Why not save yourself some time and duplicate it!

In your event list on the dashboard:
	

1. Click on the event you would like to duplicate.
2. Then click on the ‘Duplicate Event’ button.
3. You can now edit the name and date to reflect your upcoming event. Please Note - you can not edit the ‘Event Type’.
4. Click ‘Continue’ and then you are given the opportunity to edit the existing template.
5. Once finished, click ‘Save & Finish’ and your new event will now be added to your event list.


### Using the App

Once you have created an event and <a href="/customers/guides/installation">installed the app</a> on a device, you are ready to start collecting valuable data.


1. Open the app from your device home screen.
2. You will now see a list of user(s), select the appropriate user or add yourself to the list.
3. You will then see a list of events that have been set-up, select the appropriate event.
4. This will open the event and you are now ready to collect data using the app.
