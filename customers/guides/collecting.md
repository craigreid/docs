# How to Collect Data and Check-In Delegates

### Before You Start

You will need to setup at least on event on your dashboard.

### Using the App

1. Open the app on your device and wait for it to load (usually 5-10 seconds)
2. The app will ask you to select a user from a list. The first time you use the app, you will need to add an initial user. This feature allows you to track data collected by a particular person (e.g. if you incentivise data collection within a team).
3. You will be prompted to enter your passcode, the same one used when installing the app (regardless of the user).
4. Next, you will then see the event (or list of events) that you have created.
5. Select the relevant event and you are now ready to use the app for collecting data, and checking delegates in.

### What Is the Counter Icon and How Does It Work?

The icon in the top right hand corner of the app (when in a particular event) is called the counter icon, which will either be green or amber. The counter indicates the amount collected on each individual device, allowing you to check attendance levels and accurately monitor how many delegates you have signed-up/checked-in instantly. If the counter icon is:
	
* **Green** - the device is connected to the Wi-Fi and the data is automatically, in real-time, shared with the online control panel.
* **Amber** - the device is not connected to the Wi-Fi and the data is being held locally, on the device itself. The data will be shared with the control panel the next time the device to connected to a secure Wi-Fi source, and the app is opened. 


### How Do I View Statistics and Return to the Events List?

The counter icon that is visible in the top right corner of your form is also used to access the in-app events list. To do this:

* Hold your finger down on the icon and slide it along to the left. You will see a small padlock icon appear, followed by the admin panel slide out on screen. The admin panel will show summary statistics of the event so far, including:
	1. The number of attendees registered and checked-in on that device.
	2. Any unsynced data (when the app is used without Wi-Fi connectivity).
	3. Group statistics of all the Wi-Fi connected devices used at the event (accessed via the ‘Fetch event statistics’ button).
* From the panel, hit the ‘Events’ button and you will then return to your event list.
* From the event list, you can logout of the app, or access the app settings and help sections.
