All data collected can be downloaded via the Akkroo dashboard.

<p class="icon-redo">Login to the dashboard at https://www.akkroo.com/dashboard</p>

Select on the event that you wish to download the data from, and then click on the 'Email & Export' button to bring up the options of either Excel spreadsheet or CSV format.

### Bulk Export

How about downloading the data from ALL your events at once? Bulk exporting has been designed to provide a simple way to download all the data collected across your events into one single spreadsheet.


* Select the 'Settings' tab on the dashboard options panel.
* Click the 'Export All Event Data' button.
* All your data will be downloaded into a single spreadsheet (this may a few minutes depending on the amount of data).


Please Note - the ability to bulk export is only available to Account Owners, so if you need this feature enabled please contact the support team.
