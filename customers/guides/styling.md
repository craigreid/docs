### Form Styles

Choose from a selection of preset colour styles including Cool Blue, Black Tie and Chilli Red, or if you are feeling adventurous you can edit an existing style and create your own.

By clicking on the form toolbar in the Form Designer preview pane, a properties panel will appear allowing you to edit the toolbar and form colours using either specific Hex Codes or the vibrant pop-up colour palette. At anytime throughout the process, you can also:


* **Revert Colours:** Make as many changes to style of your form with the peace of mind that with one click of a button you can revert back to your default style.
* **Set as Default:** If you create a style that you would like to use for future forms, why not save yourself some time and set it as a default style.


### Attaching an Image

Simply drag and drop-in a PNG/JPEG file into the ‘Choose a Logo’ area, or click ‘Upload a file’ to select an image of your choice. To save you the tedious task of uploading the same image for multiple event forms, we have introduced the ability to store up to 10 images for quick selection. Please Note - if you have exceeded your 10 image limit, please contact the support team.

### Adding Questions

To add a field to your form, click on the ‘Add a question’ button to bring the field menu into the preview pane, or you can copy the questions from a previous event using the drop-down menu. The Form Designer has been built so each field that you add is placed directly below the previous field, however **Question Reordering** is possible with a simple left click of the mouse.

Once you have the field menu on the preview pane, you will be asked ‘WHAT KIND OF QUESTION?’ would you like to add to your form. These questions are divided into 3 sections:
	

1. Common Questions - a preset selection of commonly used questions e.g. Email.
2. Custom Questions - the wide range of data capture fields that are available for use, including drop-down lists and multiple choice radio buttons.
3. Non-Questions - the questions in your form can be organised under sub-headings, using a label.
  
Simply click on the name of the field you would like to add, e.g. you could click ‘Text’, and this will add a single text field to your form that you can re-name, and specify to whether it is required field by ticking the box ‘This question must be answered’.

Each field type contains a selection of additional options, such as an ‘Expected Response’ for the format of the information collected e.g. a Twitter username, and ‘More options’, including notifications for not answering required fields.

### Question Reordering

Whilst creating your form template, you may decide to reorder the positioning of some of your fields, so that those signing-up are more engaged with particular questions first.

To reorder your fields, left click and hold on the area surrounding the field. Then drag the cursor up and down to the position you would like the field to be in. When you let go of the left mouse button, the field will snap into its new position. Please Note - the positioning of the logo at the top of the form, and the register button at the bottom of the form, can not be altered.

### Form Settings

Every form has a set of preferences including what you would like to happen when the user hits the done button, and determining what email will get sent out on submission among other features. To access your form preferences you can click the ‘Settings’ tab in the upper right hand corner of the preview pane. Upon clicking, the form preferences panel will appear with the settings listed below:

#### Arrival Message

When using the event check-in but also allowing unregistered attendees to sign up at the event, the wording used on the initial landing screen __e.g. Welcome! Have you registered before?__

#### Success Message

Once an attendee has checked-in or submitted their details, the text used on the following screen e.g. Thanks for registering!

#### Done Screen Title

<p>This is the toolbar along the top of the ‘Done’ screen, visible to the user immediately after they submit their form.</p>

#### Email to Send Afterwards

If you would like an automated message sent to the person who fills out the form, select this option. You can customise the message via the Email Platform, and specify which message should be attached from the drop-down list provided. Your form must have an email field to use this feature.

You can also specify the ‘From Field’ of the automated emails sent, and set a custom ‘Reply Address’ incase recipients reply to the email you have sent. Please contact the support team for further information.

#### Add Delegates to an Email List

Automatically add those that check-in and sign-up to a new or existing email list, ready for post-event communication via the Email Platform.

#### Pop-up window contents

This is the content that shows when a user clicks a ‘pop-up window link’. You can use double curly braces in a question label to add a link to the pop-up window __e.g. {{Terms and Conditions}}__.
