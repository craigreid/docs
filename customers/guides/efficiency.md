# Choosing The Right Form Fields

When you stop using paper based methods and start using Akkroo, you should bear in mind that there are certain features that you can take advantage of that will make the data capture experience even better.

There is an art to building good data capture forms, and choosing the right field types requires careful consideration and is not as straightforward as you might first think - you have several options and choosing the right one is critical to collecting the best data.

Here are some things to consider:


* People filling out forms on devices can be compelled to answer 'required' questions
* People filling out forms may go away with a bad impression if you ask them to type our really long text answers and fill out very long forms
* Validated inputs can be a saviour and a burden, so choose wisely


### Required Fields

Ask yourself, is it really required? If your subject cannot proceed without completing it, you either could end up with a frustrated user, or with incorrect data polluting your database as they try to skip over it.

Remember, on paper required doesn't actually compel anyone to complete the field, so think carefully of exceptions where you might choose against a required field, or might need to double check the responses afterwards.

### Names

Do you really need to ask for First name and Last name separately? Our system will do it for you if you choose to use the Full Name field type, and this saves the user several seconds in allowing them to fill out one box instead of two.

### Picking The Right Multiple Choice Option

This one is one of the hardest to get right. You should consider these three options and criteria:


* **Tick Boxes:** allows the user to pick zero or more options
* **Multiple Choice Buttons:** allows the user to pick one option from a short list of items
* **Select Drop-down List:** allows the user to pick one option from a longer list of items


### Agree to Emails Tick Box

Remember that a 'tick' is a positive, affirming statement and that you should avoid phrasing questions so they require a tick for a  negative answer. For example,

* **Incorrect:**<br>&#9745; I am not happy for you to send me marketing material
* **Incorrect:**<br>&#9744; Do not check this box if you want to receive marketing material
* **Correct:**<br>&#9745; I am happy for you to send me marketing material

### Default Values

Remember that when you set a default value, you are may be making it easy for the user to skip that question by leaving the default value set, or put 'words into their mouths' if they do not answer it.

You need to consider if this happens, will it skew your results? Should you leave a default value, or should you force them to answer the question alone?


### Addresses
When collecting postal addresses, established what information you really should be collecting.

* Filling out long text answers (even addresses) can be tedious
* Do you really need everyone to supply this information, or are you likely to be able to/only need to request this information later?
* If you are just wanting general location information, could a simple post code question be sufficient?
* If you do need the full address, it will take longer if you have to collect every line in a separate form field
* Not all addresses follow the same format:
	* Some people do not have house numbers, only house names
	* Addresses formats can vary from single line PO Boxes, to several multiple lines
	* Foreign addresses maybe formatted completely differently or contain non-standard details
* Royal Mail only needs a postcode and a house number/house name/flat number to deliver


Royal Mail only need a postcode and house name or number...

### Phone &amp; Mobile Numbers

Do you really need to ask for two numbers these days, or could you get away with just asking for the most relevant number? Collecting both a home and mobile number now is less and less important as long as you know you can reach the person on whatever is supplied.
