# Using the E-mail Platform

We are always looking at new services to integrate with Akkroo, and the app currently supports an Email Platform, that allows you to send automated or retrospective emails to individuals that sign-up and check-in using the app.

Please Note - If this service is unavailable the Email Platform is available as an additional licence, so contact the support team for more information.

On the left hand panel in the dashboard, you will see a number of other options alongside the ‘Events’ tab. Clicking ‘Services’ and then ‘Go’ will automatically direct you into your Email Platform, where you can manage your campaign reports, upload contact lists and create content.
	
Please Note - As an extra layer security, if you work from different locations you will need to verify the IP address to access the Email Platform. Please contact the support team for more information.
