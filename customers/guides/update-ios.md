<h2>How to update to the latest version of iOS</h2>

<p>iOS is the name of the Operating System used on your Apple devices, and Akkroo has been designed to run as a web-app using iOS 6 or above.</p>
<p>Running the most up-to-date version of iOS improves the performance and range of features available to you, and consequently improves your experience with the app.</p>

<h3>Here is how you update your device wirelessly:</h3> 
<ol>
	<li>Ensure your device is connected to a power source. To avoid potential data costs connect your device to a Wi-Fi network</li>
	<li>Go to Settings > General > Software Update. iOS will automatically check for available updates. Available updates download automatically if your device is connected to Wi-Fi and a power source.
