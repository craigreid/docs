# Overview

The Akkroo API is currently under development and currently access is granted on
a case-by-case basis, however we are actively working towards a public release.

In the meanwhile, you may be able to implement based on our
[Webhook feature](/docs/webhooks) which is already available, or you can request
access by sending an e-mail to [support@akkroo.com](mailto:support@akkroo.com).
