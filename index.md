# Documentation


## REST API

Our REST API allows our customers to import, export and manage their data.

[API Documentation](/api)


## Webhooks

Our webhook system sends new data to a URL of your choosing each time a person
is added to Akkroo through data capture or event registration.

Use it to develop a statistical display of realtime information, print labels,
create accounts on your website or update your CRM.
