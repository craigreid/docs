# Webhooks

## Understanding & Using Webhooks

Webhooks are a way to tell Akkroo to call a script on your own web server when a
particular event takes place.

An example of how this might be useful is as follows,

- **Event:** new person registers at an event via Akkroo
- **Action:** Akkroo sends a message to your website asking for it to create a user account for the new person


#### Other uses could include:

- Updating a live statistics display in your office Sending a SMS message
- Printing a conference label or badge


Each of these tasks would require additional coding on your part, but Webhooks
provide a great and simple way to start extending Akkroo today.

We currently only provide a PHP library, however the principles are the same
across all languages, and if you are interested in working up a version in your
own language, we are keen to share any contributions you'd be willing to make public.
