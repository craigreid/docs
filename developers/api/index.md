# REST API Overview

The Akkroo API allows developers to build custom applications that can share data with Akkroo. This might be importing data into Akkroo before an event, or extracting data during or after an event.

The API has been built on a REST methodology, which should mean that if you have previous experience working with APIs you will probably be familiar with the choices we have made.

All of our documentation is publicly available on [Github](http://github.com/Akkroo/docs), and you're more than welcome to submit updates and change requests where you spot our mistakes, or things need a little extra clarity.
