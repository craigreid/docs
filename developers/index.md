# Akkroo for Developers

Welcome to Akkroo Developer Support. All our documentation is publicly available here so that you can get started with building your own applications and interface with Akkroo's extensive API.

<h2>REST API</h2>

<p>Our REST API allows you to import, export and manage events and the data you collect.</p>

<p>In order to use our REST API, you will need an API key which you can access from <a href="https://akkroo.com/dashboard">your dashboard</a>. </p>

<h2>Webhooks</h2>

<p>Our Webhook system will immediately send a signal to any URL of your choice each time an event takes place.</p>
<p>For example, when a person is added to Akkroo via data capture or event registration.</p>
